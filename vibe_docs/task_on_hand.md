## üìù DECISIONS MADE

### Project Decisions

- ‚úÖ **Updated CRITICAL RULES in .cursorrules** - Added requirements for "üéØVIBING..." responses, pwd checks, and web search usage
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced README.md** - Added usage commands section with session management commands

### Technical Decisions

- ‚úÖ **Added session management commands** - continue, stop this session, start where we left off
- ‚úÖ **Improved documentation structure** - Better user guidance for vibe coding workflow

### Design Decisions

- ‚úÖ **Standardized command format** - Clear, simple commands for session management

## üöÄ NEXT STEPS

1. **Immediate**: Create and merge the PR with the improvements
2. **Then**: Test the new session management commands
3. **Next**: Consider additional improvements to the vibe coding system
4. **Finally**: Document any lessons learned for future enhancements

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED TASKS

- [x] Updated CRITICAL RULES in .cursorrules with new requirements
- [x] Added usage commands section to README.md
- [x] Created PR branch `update-critical-rules`
- [x] Committed and pushed changes to GitHub
- [x] Updated task documentation with progress
