_Started: [Date]_
_Status: üîÑ DISCOVERY PHASE - Gathering Requirements_

## üìã PROJECT UNDERSTANDING

### Project Name

[To be determined through discussion]

### Project Description

[To be discovered - What problem does this solve?]

### Target Users

[Who will use this? What are their needs?]

### Success Criteria

[What defines project completion and success?]

## üîß TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: [To be determined]
- **Backend**: [To be determined]
- **Database**: [To be determined]
- **Other Tools**: [To be determined]

### Constraints

- **Timeline**: [Any deadlines?]
- **Budget**: [Resource constraints?]
- **Platform**: [Web, mobile, desktop, all?]
- **Performance**: [Speed, scale requirements?]

### Development Environment

- **OS**: [Development machine OS]
- **Existing Tools**: [Already installed tools/languages]
- **Preferences**: [Preferred languages/frameworks]

## ‚ùì OPEN QUESTIONS

### High Priority Questions (Need immediate answers)

1. What is the main problem this project aims to solve?
2. Who are the primary users and what are their key needs?
3. What does success look like for this project?
4. Are there any hard technical requirements or constraints?
5. What is the expected timeline for completion?

### Technical Questions (Need answers before starting)

1. Do you have preferences for programming languages?
2. Do you have preferences for frameworks or libraries?
3. Will this need to integrate with existing systems?
4. What are the deployment requirements?
5. Are there specific security or compliance needs?

### Design Questions (Can be refined later)

1. Do you have design mockups or wireframes?
2. Are there branding guidelines to follow?
3. What is the desired user experience?
4. Mobile-first, desktop-first, or responsive?
5. Accessibility requirements?

## üèóÔ∏è IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### Phase 1: Discovery (Current Phase)

- [ ] Gather all project requirements
- [ ] Understand technical constraints
- [ ] Define success criteria
- [ ] Create project_context.md with permanent information

### Phase 2: Planning

- [ ] Choose technology stack
- [ ] Design system architecture
- [ ] Break down into development tasks
- [ ] Set up development environment

### Phase 3: Development

- [ ] Set up project structure
- [ ] Implement core features
- [ ] Add tests
- [ ] Handle edge cases

### Phase 4: Refinement

- [ ] Polish user interface
- [ ] Optimize performance
- [ ] Add documentation
- [ ] Prepare for deployment

## üìä PROGRESS TRACKING

### Discovery Phase

- [ ] Project goals understood
- [ ] User needs identified
- [ ] Technical requirements clear
- [ ] Constraints documented
- [ ] Success criteria defined

### Setup Phase

- [ ] Technology stack chosen
- [ ] Development environment ready
- [ ] Project structure created
- [ ] Version control initialized

## üìù DECISIONS MADE

### Project Decisions

[Will be filled as decisions are made]

### Technical Decisions

[Will be filled as technical choices are made]

### Design Decisions

[Will be filled as design choices are made]

## üöÄ NEXT STEPS

1. **Immediate**: Answer the high-priority questions above
2. **Then**: Create project_context.md with permanent project information
3. **Next**: Refine technical requirements based on answers
4. **Finally**: Begin setting up development environment

**Note to LLM**: This document should be updated after EVERY conversation about the project. As questions are answered, move the information to the appropriate sections and add new questions that arise. The goal is to evolve this from a generic template to a comprehensive project specification.
